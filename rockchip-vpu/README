Current state:

The rockchip kernel contains v4l2 API breakage:
Iee08205ff3b9a54c6561e385acae8182acc73393
This means that forward-porting it would imply forward-porting the whole v4l2 stack.
I fixed as many problems as possible, but V4L2 API breakge remains, and is by far the largest number of errors.

There is a fresh v4l2 thread speaking about those APIs:

"It is Google's idea, it would be removed with new version kernel driver of mine. Also I don't like multiplanes image format from Google driver."
Implying that part is currently being rewritten
